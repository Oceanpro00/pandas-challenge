Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 4 Challenge




Data Analytics:
- The PyCity Schoolâ€™s Dataset provides us with an in-depth summary overview of the student body's statistical Maths and Reading performances across various schools within the district. As shown in the District Summary Section, the data is collected from both charter and district-type schools spanning 15 different institutions with 39,170 students in total across them all. Altogether, with a budget of over 24.5 million dollars ($24,649,428.00), the schools portray an average of B to B+ grade levels for Reading with average scores of 81.88 % and average passing rates of 85.81 %. This is already statistically considered to be comparatively better than the math grades, which seem to average C to C+ grades with average scores of 78.99 % and average passing rates of 74.98 %.
- Breaking down performance by school type reveals a significant distinction between charter and district schools. Charter schools demonstrate noticeably higher averages in both math and reading scores, with the top 5 performing schools being Charter and depicting grade point averages of 83.47 and 83.90, at least. This contrasts with the district schools, which collectively rank at the bottom of the performance scale with math scores of 76.96 and reading scores of 80.97. The disparity becomes even more evident when considering passing rates. Charter schools boast an impressive 93.70% of students passing math, while district schools lag significantly behind at 66.52%. This clear performance gap highlights the potential advantages of charter schools, possibly stemming from more tailored instruction methods, smaller class sizes, or resource allocation strategies that enhance individual student outcomes.
- Further analysis of school size reveals another important trend: smaller schools consistently seem to outperform the larger school systems. To be more specific, Schools with fewer than 1,000 students achieve on average, a math score of 83.83, this is substantially higher than the 77.48 average math score that is seen in the schools which depict over 2,000 students. Interestingly, Medium-sized schools, which depict sizes between 1,000 and 2,000 students, maintain their competitive scholastic edge, with averages of 83.37 in math and 83.87 in reading. These findings suggest that smaller and medium-sized schools may benefit from a greater ability to focus on individual students, foster better teacher-student engagement, or maintain more manageable classroom environments.
- In conclusion, the data reveals significant patterns that can guide improvements in student outcomes across the district. Charter schools consistently outperform district schools, demonstrating the potential benefits of alternative teaching methods and resource management strategies. Similarly, smaller and medium-sized schools outperform larger institutions, emphasizing the value of personalized attention and smaller class sizes. While reading scores surpass math scores overall, targeted strategies to improve math proficiency, especially in district schools and larger institutions, could help bridge performance gaps. These insights highlight opportunities for optimizing school operations and resource allocation to foster better academic performance across all schools in the district.
